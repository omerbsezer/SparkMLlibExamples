Start –> All apps –> Java –> Check For Updates

Also, Import project to Eclipse and Build Configuration Path with "jars" in the Spark Directory (important)

Spark MLlib Examples important project -> right click -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Libraries Tab -> Add External Jars -> Spark jar files in 'jars' directory
